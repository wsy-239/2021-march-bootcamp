# Q1. Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.


def factorial(x: int) -> int:
    if x < 1:
        raise Exception("input can not be < 1")

    res = 1
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        res *= i
    return res


assert factorial(1) == 1
assert factorial(9) == 362880


# Q2. Write a program which take a num and print a str as the sum of all numbers from 1 to this number
# [1 + 2 + ... + x] and x is always >= 1.

    return str(sum(range(x + 1)))

# Q3. Write a program to check is a year is leap year (x is always > 0)

# Q5. Write a program to use only 'and' and 'or' to implement 'xor'
